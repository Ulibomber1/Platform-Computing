    <h1>Arius Ulibarri</h1>
    <p>
        Hello! Welcome to my about me page. My name is Arius, a current computer systems major with a minor in computer science on 
        his last semester of college (for now). You can look at my github profile 
        <a href="https://github.com/Ulibomber1" target="_blank">here.</a>

            <p>
                I have been programming for around 8 years now, with experience in several languages. First starting out I worked with BlitzMax BASIC, 
                but afterwards I slowly transitioned to using C and C++ in Visual Studio. I programmed primarily labs for my classes, and a few 
                Project Euler programming exercises for practice. Once I transferred here to CSUSB, I had started using Unity to develop video games 
                which required me to learn C# and the Unity scripting API. I have a few games I had a part in creating on Itch.io: MechroKnight and 
                Crystalpunk. I most recently learned to use the Godot game engine as well, which can also use C# as a scripting language. I have no 
                games made in the engine yet, but I am slowly learning how to use it.

                I am set to graduate soon, so I am currently looking for career opportunities in the software engineering and game programming fields. 
                At the same time, once I have graduated I will also be working on my portfolio of programming projects and compiling them together on 
                my own website and on LinkedIn, Discord, etc.
